## Disparities in the Chicago Police Department regarding Incentives and Disciplinary Actions

Behavior in any system is molded through feedback. The Chicago Police Department(CPD) isn’t impervious to the same. Feedback comes in many forms, such as encouraging good behavior and discouraging bad behavior. A disparity in feedback for the same/similar actions propels individuals towards unwanted behaviors and also drives down the morale of good officers. In CPD, the feedback might have an imbalance on the basis of various factors like race, gender and age. This imbalance probably has an effect on the way policing varies across the various districts of Chicago. In this paper we will introduce the data through which we can say that there is an imbalance in the feedback based on race. 

In this project we asked two main questions over feedback and analyzed disparities over 5 checkpoints:
1. Are officers’ recognition imbalanced with respect to the race of the officers?
2. Are disciplinary actions taken against misconduct alleged officers imbalanced based on the racial makeup of the external population?
